## OPTIMIZATIONS & IMPROVEMENTS

### Bonsai System
- **Reworked and improved bonsais:**
  - Animation now starts instantly when placing them, instead of waiting a full cycle.  
  - Added `scriptevent` support to register **custom bonsais** (for use in *Bountiful Trees* and other addons).  
  - Custom bonsais now support a new property that **disables time and yield bonuses**.

## BUG FIXES

- Fixed **Endstone recipe** in the Crusher.  
- Fixed **Steel tools** not working properly.  
- Fixed **Assembler** filling output slots when receiving items from Mechanical Hoppers or Item Conduits.  
- Fixed **Block Placer** not accepting input items.  
- Fixed **Asphalt** giving speed to *any* mob instead of just players.  
- Fixed **Mechanical Hopper and Uppers** item transfer inconsistencies near input zones.

## BALANCE CHANGES

- Balanced **AIOTs**, **Paxels**, and **Hammers** to provide consistent damage scaling across all tiers.  
- Improved **item transfer and extraction** logic for all container types (machines, chests, hoppers, etc.).
